# Health-Tracker

This project aims to track changes in weight, as well as caloric intake. My personal goal is to steadily gain weight until I am 215 lbs. Ideally much of this weight should be lean muscle mass, and so I should eat at a daily caloric surplus between 250 and 500. There are 3500 calories in a lb, so those numbers translate to between half a lb and 1 lb of body weight gain per week. We aim to predict my total daily energy expenditure in order to better estimate the amount of food that I need to eat daily.
